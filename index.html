I am currently studying for the DPhil degree in mathematics at the University of Oxford. My supervisor is Professor
Stuart White. On November 2022, I completed the MSc (Mathematics and Statistics) degree at 
the University of Melbourne under the supervision of Professor Arun Ram.</br>  
</br> 
On this website, you will find my CV, some selected resources pertaining to mathematics and links to other websites which I find helpful. </br>   
</br> 
I find a wide range of mathematics interesting. At the moment, I am most interested in functional analysis, C*-algebras and operator theory. 
My current research focuses on nuclear dimension, a non-commutative analogue of topological dimension for C*-algebras. 
Please refer to the notes I host on this website in order to see the kinds of mathematics I have studied. </br>
