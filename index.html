I am currently studying for the DPhil degree in mathematics at the University of Oxford. My supervisor is Professor
Stuart White. On November 2022, I completed the MSc (Mathematics and Statistics) degree at 
the University of Melbourne under the supervision of Professor Arun Ram.</br>  
</br> 
On this website, you will find my CV and a selection of typed documents on a variety of mathematical topics. </br>   
</br> 
I find a wide range of mathematics interesting. Broadly speaking, my research is on C*-algebras and operator theory. Specifically, 
I am very interested in graph C*-algebras, nuclear dimension and the Cuntz semigroup.
Please refer to the notes I host on this website in order to see the kinds of mathematics I have studied. </br>
