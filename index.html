Hello. My name is Brian (Yao Ming) Chan and I am currently in my final semester of the MSc (Mathematics and Statistics) degree at 
the University of Melbourne. </br>  
</br> 
On this website, you will find my CV, some selected resources pertaining to mathematics and links to other websites which I find helpful. </br>   
</br> 
I find a wide range of mathematics interesting. At the moment, I am most interested in functional analysis, C*-algebras and operator theory. 
I am also interested in category theory. </br>   
</br> 
Currently, I have not published any papers.
