# Algebraic Geometry

[MAG 1 Notes](MAG1 Algebraic Geometry Notes.pdf)

On June 2022, Dan Murfet and Ken Chan taught an eight week introductory course in algebraic geometry called MAG1 (Metauni Algebraic Geometry 1). Central to the course is the notion of a Gr√∂bner basis. These are my typed notes regarding the course. 

[Snake lemma](Snake Lemma.pdf)

This document contains a proof of the Snake lemma in an abelian category. 

# Category Theory

[Category theory and internal structures](Category theory and internal structures.pdf)

This document develops the notions of unital, protomodular, and Mal'tsev categories, which generalises particular observations about the categories of monoids, commutative monoids, abelian groups and groups. 

[Yoneda lemma](Yoneda Lemma.pdf)

This document contains a proof of the Yoneda lemma, which is fundamental to category theory. 

# Functional Analysis

[Some notes on functional analysis](Some notes on functional analysis.pdf)

This document marks the first time I used and learnt LaTeX. I first created this document in the middle of 2019. The document consists of material usually found in a first course on functional analysis. The creation of this document first sparked my interest in functional analysis. 

[An introduction to operator theory](An introduction to operator theory.pdf)

This document studies operators on a Hilbert space, beginning with bounded operators on a Hilbert space which is the prototypical example of a C*-algebra. In particular, the z-transform is introduced as a useful tool to study closed, densely defined operators on a Hilbert space. 

# Integrable systems

[The Ising model](The Ising Model.pdf)

Various aspects of the Ising model are discussed in this document. 

[The R matrix of the six vertex model](The R matrix.pdf)

In this document, the form of the R matrix is derived for the six vertex model. 

# Linear Algebra

MSc Thesis (Not yet available)

Wedge product matrices are developed as a generalisation to the determinant of a square matrix with entries in a commutative ring. In tandem
with a method Robert Steinberg used to prove a variant of the Bruhat decomposition, the two ideas were applied to various problems in linear
algebra. Notably, they were used to generalise the eigenvector-eigenvalue identity and the notion of a quasideterminant in a non-commutative ring. They were also applied to the construction of representatives of two different matrix orbit spaces.

[Matrices invariant under Lambda 2](Lambda 2 Invariant Matrices.pdf)

This document highlights a small, but interesting question arising from the work in my MSc thesis.

[Eigenvalues of minor matrices](Eigenvalues of Minor Matrices V2.pdf)

A generalisation of the eigenvector-eigenvalue identity is developed and studied in this document. Again, this relies on material developed in my MSc thesis. 

# Miscellaneous

[On a particular integral](On a particular integral.pdf)

This document highlights a (hopefully) interesting method of computing a particular integral.
