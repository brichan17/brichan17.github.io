# Functional Analysis

[Some notes on functional analysis](Some notes on functional analysis.pdf)

This document marks the first time I used and learnt LaTeX. I first created this document in the middle of 2019. The document consists of material usually found in a first course on functional analysis. The creation of this document first sparked my interest in functional analysis. 

[An introduction to operator theory](An introduction to operator theory.pdf)

This document studies operators on a Hilbert space, beginning with bounded operators on a Hilbert space which is the prototypical example of a C*-algebra. In particular, the z-transform is introduced as a tool to study closed, densely defined operators on a Hilbert space. 

# Linear Algebra
