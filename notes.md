# Algebraic Geometry

[MAG 1 Notes](MAG1 Algebraic Geometry Notes.pdf)

On June 2022, Dan Murfet and Ken Chan taught an eight week introductory course in algebraic geometry called MAG1 (Metauni Algebraic Geometry 1). Central to the course is the notion of a Gr√∂bner basis. These are my typed notes regarding the course. 

# Category Theory

[Category theory and internal structures](Category theory and internal structures.pdf)

This document develops the notions of unital, protomodular, and Mal'tsev categories, which generalises particular observations about the categories of monoids, commutative monoids, abelian groups and groups. 

# Functional Analysis

[Some notes on functional analysis](Some notes on functional analysis.pdf)

This document marks the first time I used and learnt LaTeX. I first created this document in the middle of 2019. The document consists of material usually found in a first course on functional analysis. The creation of this document first sparked my interest in functional analysis. 

[An introduction to operator theory](An introduction to operator theory.pdf)

This document studies operators on a Hilbert space, beginning with bounded operators on a Hilbert space which is the prototypical example of a C*-algebra. In particular, the z-transform is introduced as a useful tool to study closed, densely defined operators on a Hilbert space. 

# Integrable systems

[The Ising model](The Ising Model.pdf)

Various aspects of the Ising model are discussed in this document. 

[The R matrix of the six vertex model](The R matrix.pdf)

In this document, the form of the R matrix is derived for the six vertex model. 


# Linear Algebra
